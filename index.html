	<h2> What is cryptography? </h2>
	<p> Coming from the Greek word kryptos, cryptography, or cryptology is the study of techniques to secure information by encrypting them and closing off access to third parties. 
	In computer science, cryptography refers to the use of mathematics and its concepts of algorithms to transfer messages and information that canâ€™t
	easily be deciphered.
