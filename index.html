	<h2> What is cryptography? </h2>
	<p> Coming from the Greek word kryptos, cryptography, or cryptology is the study of techniques to secure information by encrypting them and closing off access to third parties. 
	In computer science, cryptography refers to the use of mathematics and its concepts of algorithms to transfer messages and information that can’t
	easily be deciphered.

	<p> From the little activity you did by changing the image, you have seen a glimpse of what cryptography was like before and now. </p>

	<h2> Cryptography vs. Cryptology </h2>
	<br>
	<p> Cryptography is the art of keeping information secure by transforming it into a form that unintended recipients cannot understand. 
		In cryptography, an original human-readable message, referred to as plaintext, is changed by means of an algorithm, or series of mathematical operations, 
		into something that to an uninformed observer would look like gibberish; this gibberish is called ciphertext.
	</p>
		<br>

	<p> Cryptography, in a literal sense, means “secret writing” while cryptology means “knowledge of secrecy”. Though these two terms are often used interchangeably, 
		it’s good to keep this information in mind. </p>
	<p>
           Cryptography comes from encrypting something. Which means to turn plaintext into cypher text. To encrypt plaintext, we’ll need an algorithm along with a key. </p>
	<br>
	<p>
           A key, almost always a number, specifies how the algorithm should work to encrypt the plaintext you want to encrypt. To make good encryption of your message, 
		when coming up with a key and an algorithm, you should try your best to make sure that without the key, the algorithm will be near impossible to decrypt. </p>
