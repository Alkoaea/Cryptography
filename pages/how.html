		  <h2> Computer Security </h2>
		  <p> Cryptography is used in computer science when it comes to matters concerning the safety of the information and user. 
			  You might be familiar with terms like Cyber Security, computer security, or IT security. 
			  These are used to protect computer hardware and software and information from theft and damage that might harm the device and valuable information within. 
			  This can be seen as controlling both the physical access to the hardware and protecting against harm that may come from network access, data, and code injection.
