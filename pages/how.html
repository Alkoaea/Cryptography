		  <h2> Computer Security </h2>
		  <p> Cryptography is used in computer science when it comes to matters concerning the safety of the information and user. 
			  You might be familiar with terms like Cyber Security, computer security, or IT security. 
			  These are used to protect computer hardware and software and information from theft and damage that might harm the device and valuable information within. 
			  This can be seen as controlling both the physical access to the hardware and protecting against harm that may come from network access, data, and code injection.

		  <h3> "A cryptographic system should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge." - Kerckhoffs </h3>
		  <br>
		  <h3> "The enemy knows the system." - Claude Shannon </h3>
		  <br>
		  <p> What do these two quotes have in common? They both mean that the algorithm you want to design doesn’t have to be secret to successfully conceal information. </p>
		  <br>
		  <p> As the internet is growing and advancing and becoming more widespread in its use, more and more information traveling across the internet needs to be encrypted. “Lucifer”, made by IBM in the 1960s made its way codified to the US National Bureau of Standards as the first Data Encryption Standard (DES). </p>
		  <p> Today, cryptography has several uses. And these are to: </p>
		  <ol>
			  <ul> Keep data confidential. </ul>
 			<ul> Authenticate identity of a message's sender and receiver. </ul>
			<ul> Ensure the integrity of the data, showing that it hasn't been altered. </ul>
			<ul> Demonstrate that the supposed sender really sent this message, a principle known as non-repudiation. </ul>
