	  <h1> What are the two types of Cryptography? </h1>
	  <p> Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Cryptography </p>
	  <h2> Symmetrical Cryptography </h2>
	  <p> Symmetrical Cryptography is easy and fasts to transfer. As long as the key is kept secret between the two parties, both parties can be sure that they are communicating
		  with each other as long as the encrypted messages transferred continue to make sense. Examples of symmetrical cryptography would be Caesar Cipher, AES, DES, and 3DES</p>
	  <br>
	  <p> Why do we use symmetrical cryptography? </p>
	  <ol>
		  <ul> Relatively inexpensive for its quality of protection </ul>
		  <ul> Algorithms are cheaper to process </ul>
		  <ul> Keys are smaller and don’t cost as much </ul>
		  <ul> Requires only one key and is more efficient when transferring bulks of data than asymmetric cryptography. </ul>
	  </ol>
	  <h2> Asymmetric Cryptography </h2>
	  <p> Asymmetric Cryptography also known as public key cryptography is the process of using related keys, both public and private to encrypt messages and protect them from unauthorized access. </p>
	  <br>
	  <h2> Why use Asymmetric Cryptography? </h2>
	  <p>  Asymmetric Cryptography is more secure compared to symmetric cryptography because it increases data security. Private keys are never required to be revealed, so the chances of cybercrime being committed to the user are decreased and increase the user’s comfortability during transmission.</p>
