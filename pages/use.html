	  <p> If we’ll look into the history of cryptography, we’ll meet one of the most recognizable figures in history. That is, Julius Caeser. When he had to send classified messages for his correspondence, he would shift his letters 3 ways to the left. So if he had to use “D” he’d write down “A”, and “B” for “E”, and so on. Below is a guide that can serve as a visual aid in case you’d like to try encrypting your messages this way :)).

	  <center> <h2> Music Cryptography </h2> </center>
	  <p> Music Cryptography is the cryptogrammatic sequence form of cryptography of musical symbols. Alternatively known as ‘extra-musical text’ by some logical relationship
		  between note names and letters. Ranging from notes A through G, these notes form words, abbreviations, and clues to hidden information.

	  <p> The most prominent form of music cryptography is the B-A-C-H motif, used by German Composer, Johann Sebastian Bach himself, his contemporaries, and many more composers after him. </p>
	  <p>
		  Though not used anymore, Bach managed to sign his name in one of his defining choral works and it was hidden for 250 years. So if you're feeling bored and you're into writing music,
		  learn from the old and maybe encrypt something funny into your pieces to be discovered over 200 years after your death. Here's an example from one of his works: </p>

	  <h2> Cryptography in WW2 </h2>
	 
	  <p> Cryptography was used extensively in World War II to help with communicating signals for different operations by both the Axis powers and the Allied nations. 
		  Nations involved used a plethora of codes, cypher codes, enigma machines, and rotor machines. </p>
	  <br>
	  <p> 
Enigma Cipher was used by the Germans and was first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau around 1932. Later on, the techniques were passed and were passed to the French and British allies before the war broke out in 1939.
